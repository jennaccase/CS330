# Computational Graphics and Visualization - Final Project

# How do I approach designing software?

My final project for this class was to recreate a 2D picture in the 3D space. I chose a picture of a plate of breakfast, including a fried egg, toast, and bacon on a plate. I was able to succesfully get a 3D image of a fried egg along with a moving camera, lighting, and textures. I have never created a 3D image like this before so this has been a totally new skill for me to learn. My design process was pretty simple in breaking everything down and tryong to et the individual components to work before trying to get the big picture together. Taking this project piece by piece allowed me to get some functioning code and an image to show.

# How do I approach developing programs?

I learned a lot of great development strategies with this project. Using the tutorials, I was able to build the project piece by piece. I was also able to utilize some prewritten code for the cylinder shape and copy that to create the egg shape. At the beginning of the project, I just tried to through everything together and hope for the best. By the end of the class, I was able to format my code in a way that I could reuse code to create shapes and shorten it pretty signifigantly. My approach to development is completely different now for the best.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My future career goal is to work in data analysis in the manufactuing industry. Computational graphics and visualization is something that I will probably not use much in my professional or educational future. However, I think it is really important to be well rounded as a computer science professional. I am glad for the experience I had in this class ad it has helped me learn how to organize code a little better. The biggest takeaway for me from this class is perseverance and knowing when to ask for help. While I may not use computational graphics much in the future, I have learned a lot in this class.
